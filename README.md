# aud-exercises-ws17
C-programs jointly developed with students during the „Algorithmen und  Datenstrukturen“ exercises during the winter term 2017/18.

Setup and running instructions:

1. Obtain a C-compiler of your choice; I use the Gnu Compiler Collection (gcc).
2. Compile the program `name.c` by running 
`gcc -ansi -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic name.c`. 
This will create an executable with the name `a.out`. The compiler flags enforce syntactic restrictions that are very close to the description of C in the official lecture material.
3. To run `a.out` from a unix-like system, type `./a.out`.


I have added the solutions of the tasks not solved in the last tutorial (tut-14).
